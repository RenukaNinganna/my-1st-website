    <p> Once upon a time there lived a very happy family with a little puppy. The children always took care of there puppy. One day the children took there puppy to the park for a walk. When they got to the park it started to rain. The children started to run, but they forgot the leach for the dog. So they left the puppy all alone in the park. The puppy started to run and scream. The puppy got so scared that it hid in the shade. The children went to the park and started to look for the puppy. The children couldn’t find the puppy so, they went back home and told their parents that they couldn’t find the puppy. Their mum sent their dad to the park to find the puppy. The puppy tried to find his way home but, he got lost when he tried to get home by himself. Their dad went back home and told them that he couldn’t find the puppy. Then they called some people to help them find their puppy. They called their family members. They searched around the park to find the puppy. The next day the children went to school. They had a sad looking face because, they really missed their puppy. After school their parents had a happy looking face. The children asked their parents why they had a happy face. Then their parents took them home and showed them why they were happy. They showed them the puppy. The children were really happy so, they told their mum and dad that they will never ever leave their puppy at the park ever again.</p>
