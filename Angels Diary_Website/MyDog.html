    <p>My little charm of my life is my puppy.His name is Bosco.Yeah you heard it right!!. His hair-colour is golden 'n'brown,his eye-colour is also brown.His favourite food is chicken liver chunks.Bosco's breed is labrador; class MALE.He was gifted on my birthday by my aunt.I always thank my aunt for this special gift.Soon he was beloved by others. If i get a little injury on my hands or my legs,he licks on that place.I take him for a walk everyday.</p>
